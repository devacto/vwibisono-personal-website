# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 8080
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run build:dev` - Build in development mode
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Architecture Overview

This is a React personal website built with:

- **Framework**: Vite + React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Routing**: React Router DOM (single-page app)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite with SWC for fast compilation

## Project Structure

- `src/App.tsx` - Main app component with routing setup and providers
- `src/pages/` - Page components (Index, NotFound)
- `src/components/` - React components including Hero section
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui component library (complete set)
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions (tailwind-merge, clsx)
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks

## Key Technical Details

**Path Aliases**: The project uses `@/` alias mapping to `./src/` configured in both Vite and TypeScript.

**Component System**: Built on shadcn/ui with comprehensive component library already installed. Components follow the shadcn pattern with variants using class-variance-authority.

**Styling System**: Uses Tailwind with CSS variables for theming. Custom Caveat font is configured for handwritten-style text.

**TypeScript Configuration**: Relaxed settings with `noImplicitAny: false`, `strictNullChecks: false` for rapid development.

**Lovable Integration**: This project was generated by Lovable and includes the lovable-tagger plugin for development mode component tracking.

## Current State

The website currently shows a single Hero section on the homepage with:
- Personal introduction for Victor
- Social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Call-to-action buttons for articles and resume
- Blue gradient background with responsive design

Navigation and footer components exist but are not currently being used in the main layout.
